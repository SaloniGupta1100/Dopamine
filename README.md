<h2> Project Inspiraition</h2>

We live in a world where you can be surrounded by people, but still feel lonely, with nobody to turn to when things get rough.But being heard is an important part of being human. Psychologist, Glen Moriarty saw that there was great power in listening, but he knew not everyone had someone to talk to. He started to wonder. "How can I make being heard a reality for everyone? That's why Dopamine was born.Thanks to thousands of volunteer listeners stepping up to lend a friendly ear, Dopamine aims to say, "We're here for you!" No matter who you are or what you're going through, this is a place where you'll be heard and cared for. We might be strangers on the surface, but underneath we're just the friends you haven't met yet.
