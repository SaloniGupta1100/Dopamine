            </p>

            <p class="Intro" id="intro">
                Our mind has a tendency to dwell on negative thoughts and feelings if left to its own. While you need to summon all your energy and focus to stay positive, a momentary lack of concentration can let you slip into negative territory.
                <br><br>
                And this is the main reason for the overwhelming presence of anxiety in the population. You don’t need to put in any particular effort to trigger anxiety, while you need to evoke all your willpower to get out of it.
                <br><br>
                When anxiety is in its milder form or as a preventive, activities and exercises can help you keep it at bay

                6 Stress relief activities to help you manage your anxiety :-
            </p>

            <p class="Intro">
                <br><strong>Exercise</strong> : Physical exertion is one of the best antidotes to stress and anxiety. Though it may sound contradictory, putting more strain on your body can help in taking the pressure off your mind. 
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Spend more time with near and dear ones</strong> : The social support offered by your family and friends can give you a sense of belonging and remove the feeling of being alone. The confidence and self-worth you gain through your association with people who care for you can help you survive stress-inducing episodes.
                <br><br>
                Social support benefits both men and women, though women are known to benefit more from it. Close contact with friends, family, and especially children has been found to boost the production of the happy hormone oxytocin in women. 
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, those who resist social contacts and prefer their own company are found to be more susceptible to anxiety, stress, and depression.
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Laugh more</strong> : Laughter offers a vital break from the negative thoughts that feed your anxiety. It is known to improve your mental as well as physical health. In fact, it is hard to feel stressed when you are laughing.
                <br><br>
                Laughter improves your mood and triggers the release of happy hormones. It works on your muscles and helps them to relax and bring down tension in them. Laughter boosts your immune system and helps in improving your physical health. This also has a direct consequence on your mental health.
                <br><br>
                Seek ways to laugh more. Watching a comedy show, reading a humorous book, spending time with your family and friends are all choices for you to try. Laughter clubs and laughter yoga are some more options for you to choose from. 
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Gratitude journal</strong> : When you feel the stress level is getting out of hand, you can try the simple technique of writing down your thoughts. Anxiety will make you dwell on the same topic that is the cause of trouble for days together. Your mind will be going round in circles, trying to make some sense of it.
                <br><br>
                When you are analyzing the incident that triggered the anxiety attack, you are under the impression that you are trying to find an alternate ending or a solution to the dilemma. When you choose to write down your thoughts, it will give you more clarity and provide you with the answers you are searching for.
                <br><br>
                Once you have resolved the immediate crisis, you can continue your journaling activity by writing down what you are grateful for. Maintaining a daily gratitude journal is a sure way to induce positive thinking. And we know positivity and anxiety cannot co-exist.
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Avoid procrastination</strong> : Often you feel stressed when work piles up and you feel overwhelmed by it. Procrastinating or putting off things can only add to stress levels. Avoid this by prioritizing your duties and responsibilities.
                <br><br>
                When you are always trying to catch up on your work, no wonder you feel stressed. Making a to-do list, prioritizing work, and setting yourself realistic deadlines can make life easier for you. 
                <br><br>
                If you are comfortable with multi-tasking, go right ahead and get more work done. If managing multiple tasks simultaneously or switching between tasks is giving you nightmares, avoid them. Don’t do it to look cool or to save time. It is just not worth the mental agony.
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Learn to say no</strong> : It may sound too simple or even silly. But most of us have a hard time saying no and some even don’t know how to.
                <br><br>
                Taking on more than you can handle is a sure way to invite stress into your life. You can avoid this just by learning to say no to that extra work you are asked to do. 
                <br><br>
                Tight deadlines, too much work, or juggling too many tasks can make you feel overwhelmed and stressed out. All you need to do is to understand your capabilities and take on the work you are comfortable with.
                <br><br>
                Pampering yourself with a massage or aromatherapy, practicing mindfulness, listening to your favorite music, yoga, or deep breathing exercises are all beneficial in relieving anxiety. Physical contact with a loved one such as hugging, cuddling, or kissing is a known stress buster.
                <br><br>
                Avoiding addictive substances and caffeine acts as a preventive for anxiety and stress. Taking health supplements can also help you overcome stress. Omega-3 fatty acids, green tea, lemon balm, and kava kava are all proven antidotes to tension, stress, and anxiety.
                <br><br>
                Prevention is always better than cure. When stressful situations are unavoidable, do make sure that it doesn’t get unmanageable. Early intervention can make a huge difference.

                Mood Swings
            </p>

            <p class="Intro" id="intro">
                Mood swings are one of the most common symptoms of menopause. Fluctuating hormone levels can result in varied emotions throughout the day, which can become exhausting. One moment you'll be fine, and the next moment sobbing hysterically. Feelings of anger and anxiety can make you feel unlike your usual self, which may disrupt your life or put strain on your relationships. It is more important than ever to keep your body and mind regulated through movement. There are many uplifting activities that can directly affect your brain chemistry and exude joy and balance. Maintain a healthy mindset safely and effectively.

            <p class="SubHeading" id="subHeading">
                Activities to help you manage your Mood Swings are :-
            </p>

            <p class="Intro">
                <br><strong>Yoga</strong> : This activity is known for its ability to ease anxiety. Beyond being a great physical workout, it has a strong emphasis on establishing peace of mind.  Through deep breathing, balancing, strengthening, and stretching, you let go of thoughts and improve focus. At the same time, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is released by the brain, which brings on strong feelings of tranquility. 
                
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Hiking</strong> : The social support offered by your family and friends can give you a sense of belonging and remove the feeling of being alone. The confidence and self-worth you gain through your association with people who care for you can help you survive stress-inducing episodes.
            
                <br><br><br><br><strong>Laugh more</strong> : Cardio is great because it energizes you and increases levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel joyous. When you go for a hike through a nature trail, you can be extremely rejuvenated. The bright sun will provide you with mood-boosting vitamin D, and the colors and sounds of nature can relax your nervous system. This is a very positive activity for getting perspective on life and appreciating the pleasures of the earth.

                <br><br><br><br><strong>Dancing</strong> : Go dancing with friends or family. The music, movement, and interaction may often make you feel expressed and connected with others. Dancing is one of the most enjoyable ways to improve cardiovascular health. When you do it with others, your brain releases oxytocin, which exudes feelings of friendship and loyalty. Your worries will likely stand no chance against your dance moves.

                <br><br><br><br><strong>Cooking</strong> : Cooking can be an extremely serene activity. There is a reason why chefs are so passionate about it and become so involved. Food is your sustenance. When you become fully involved in the process of preparation, you can appreciate it more.
                <br><br>
                Lay out all of your ingredients. When you cut the vegetables, take in the colors and scents. When the ingredients sizzle on the pan, enjoy the sounds and changes in the food as it's cooked. When you serve it on the plates, do it with care and concentration, enjoying the aroma. Finally, upon eating your creation, you can take in the flavors and feel it nourish your body.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes the simplest activities can be the most relaxing. Do not underestimate the benefits of moving to a song or creating a delicious dinner. If you make sure to incorporate these four activities into each week, it can help improve your mood. Each can soothe anxiety and help you focus on more positive aspects of life. With movement comes appreciation and emotional well-being.
